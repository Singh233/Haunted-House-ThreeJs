# 👻 Haunted House Three.Js

The project involves building a haunted house scene using Three.js primitives as geometries and textures. The aim is to create a spooky and unsettling atmosphere for the viewer by using a combination of different Three.js primitives and textures to construct various elements of the haunted house. The project requires a good understanding of Three.js and the ability to work with textures and geometries to create a realistic and immersive environment.

❗️❗️❗️Please note that this project is a work in progress, and some features may not be fully functional or available at this time.
